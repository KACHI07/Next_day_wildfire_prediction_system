Wildfire Next-Day Spread Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict the next-day spread of wildfires using historical fire data and environmental variables such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, vegetation, drought index, and population density. An ensemble model combining Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree classifiers is trained to perform binary classification, predicting whether fire will be present (1) or not (0) in each 1 km × 1 km area.

The model is trained on real wildfire events from the United States and evaluated using visual fire mask comparisons and classification metrics. Despite challenges caused by severe class imbalance, the project demonstrates that machine learning can provide valuable short-term wildfire spread insights to support emergency response, resource allocation, and evacuation planning.

This work highlights both the potential and limitations of traditional ML approaches for wildfire forecasting and lays the foundation for future improvements using deep learning, spatial modeling, and real-time satellite data integration.
